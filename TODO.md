## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Context Window & Cell Order**
   - Moving cells in notebook doesn't update context properly
   - Need to track both execution order and visual order

2. **Graph Visualization**

   - No visual feedback for context dependencies

3. **Session Persistence**
   - No way to save/restore kernel state
   - Context is lost on kernel restart

## Priority Order

1. **Immediate**: 
   - Fix context tracking with cell reordering
   - Complete `%%hide` cell magic implementation ‚úÖ

2. **High**: 
   - Implement missing magic commands (`%llm_graph`, export/import)
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration

3. **Medium**: 
   - Add visualization features
   - GitHub Copilot Workspace integration
   - Editable context (input AND output editing)
   - Context import/export enhancements

4. **Low**: 
   - Advanced features from roadmap

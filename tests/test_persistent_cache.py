Persistent File Cache Test
==========================

The LLM Kernel now implements a hybrid approach for file persistence:

1. **Local Cache** (.llm_kernel_cache/)
   - All pasted files are cached locally
   - Files persist across notebook sessions
   - Automatic deduplication by file hash

2. **Smart Uploads**
   - Files are uploaded to provider APIs (OpenAI, etc.)
   - Upload IDs are tracked and reused
   - Re-uploads automatically if expired

3. **Notebook Persistence**
   - File metadata stored in conversation
   - On reload, files are restored from cache
   - Seamless continuation of conversations

Test Instructions:
==================

1. Paste a PDF:
   %llm_paste
   
2. Check the cache:
   %llm_cache_info
   %llm_cache_list
   
3. Ask about the PDF:
   What's in this document?
   
4. Save and reload the notebook
   - The PDF reference persists
   - File is restored from cache if needed
   - No manual re-upload required!

Cache Management:
-----------------
%llm_cache_info          # Show cache statistics
%llm_cache_list          # List all cached files
%llm_cache_list pdf      # List only PDFs
%llm_cache_clear         # Clear all cached files
%llm_cache_clear --days=7  # Clear files older than 7 days

Benefits:
---------
✓ Files persist with notebook
✓ No re-uploading same files
✓ Works offline (files cached locally)
✓ Automatic cleanup options
✓ Efficient storage (deduplication)

The .llm_kernel_cache/ directory is git-ignored by default.

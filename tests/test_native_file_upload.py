Native File Upload Test
=======================

The LLM Kernel now uses native file uploads for PDFs!

How it works:
1. Files are uploaded to the provider's API (OpenAI Files API, etc.)
2. The file gets a unique file_id
3. Messages reference the file_id instead of embedding content
4. Files are cached to avoid re-uploading

Benefits:
- Much more efficient (no base64 encoding)
- Faster processing
- Lower token usage
- Better PDF text extraction
- Native provider support

Test Instructions:
==================

1. Copy a PDF file (Ctrl+C)
2. Paste it:
   %llm_paste
   
   You should see:
   âœ… Uploaded PDF 'document.pdf' (2.3 MB)
   ðŸ“Ž File ID: file-abc123xyz...
   
3. Ask questions:
   What's in this PDF?
   Summarize the key points
   
The PDF is uploaded once and referenced by ID!

Fallback:
---------
If upload fails (missing API key, unsupported provider, etc.),
it automatically falls back to image conversion.

Debug:
------
# List uploaded files:
%llm_files_list

# Clear file cache:
%llm_files_clear
